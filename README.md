# The AusPedition project

*(Note: this is a backup of our original project from github.sydney.edu.au, in case the latter becomes unavaliable later)*

## Project Description
AusPedition is a website for the people who are interested in visting Asutralia and it provides them with basic information about the destinations, attractions and so on. 

The users are able to view the destinations, attractions as well as the weekly recommendations. They can also search or filter those things in order to find what they want to know about. They are also able to sign up or log in to like/dislike, bookmark or leave comments on specific destinations or attractions and undo those actions when they want to. There is an admin account in place to delete any inapporiate content.
 
## Languages and Tools
### Frontend: HTML, CSS (both raw CSS and Bootstrap) and AJAX
### Backend and API: Django the REST framework.
