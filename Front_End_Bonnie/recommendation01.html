                The University of Sydney was founded in 1850 and is located in Sydney, Australia's largest city, making it the oldest 
                university in the country. It's also ranked in the top 10 most beautiful campuses in the world! At the same time, the 
                University of Sydney is one of the p remier halls of academia in the entire southern hemisphere and a globally renowned
                institution of higher learning. There are many prominent politicians and business people who study here.
                An interesting rumor to share with you is that many people come here not because of the academic status of the 
                University of Sydney, but because they don't know who said that the Harry Potter movie was set here. The fact is that
                Harry Potter was not actually set here, but it's just like Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a very old and
                mysterious building.

                    The design of the main Fontenoy building follows the tradition of British universities. The glass paintings in the Great Hall include 
                    windows from Oxford, Cambridge and the Royal Family. The stonework also features the heads of Queen Victoria and the Prince, the initials
                    "VR" and the royal motto. You'll also find royal symbols in the main Fontenoy building: the crown and the Tudor rose. The Great Hall is 
                    used for different events such as graduation ceremonies. In the right hand corner of the main building is a beautiful Jacaranda tree, 
                    and it's said that when it's in full bloom, it's too late to study. However, for us students, reading under the blue tree and listening 
                    to the melodious music of the zither was a very pleasant experience. Also, the Nicholson Museum is highly recommended to visit. The 
                    collection includes valuable historical artefacts from Ancient Greece, Italy and the Mediterranean civilisation, and is the largest 
                    European antiques museum in Australia.

                    <h5>Graffiti Tunnel</h5> 
                    <p> The graffiti tunnel is a legal graffiti wall located between the Holme Building and Manning House, and it is the
                        only place on campus where spray paint is allowed. It is the only place on campus where graffiti can be spray painted, but 
                        university authorities and campus security have ruled that only "civilized" works of art are allowed, and no graffiti can be 
                        sprayed on doorknobs. We share our insights and ideas on this street and feel the different cultures we pass on. It is also a 
                        popular place for students and tourists to take photos.
